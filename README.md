My first ever project, which I made to graduate from WEB development courses

It was designed to be responsive <br>
You have an ability to search for a profile <br>
There are modals <br>
Galleries <br>
Video pop-ups <br>
Uses BootStrap <br>
Uses PHP <br>
and is connected to a MySQL database <br>
<br>
<br>
To run the page locally, I used XAMPP and PHP 7.4. <br>
Download this folder and extract all the files inside your XAMPP/htdocs folder. <br> 
Open the XAMPP control panel and start Apache and MySQL. <br>
In your PHPmyadmin, create a database called news_blog. Inside it, import the file you downloaded from this folder - news_blog.sql <br> 
The project should run in your browser at localhost/sk-ent/
